## Thoughts {.md-title}
KabanDon was made from my attempts to find a system that best worked with my (at the 
time) undiagnosed ADHD. I work best when there is a physical representation of the 
goal I am wanting to reach in front of me.

I created this app with Svelte as my experience with other frameworks such as React
was such that using them was always a frustration in having to navigate the various
ways React as opinionated as a framework and yet couldn't care less as a library. Also I 
wanted a framework that had an inbuilt state management system as React's state
management options felt- and are, to an extent, literally- tacked on.

## Future Improvements {.md-title}
- Drag and Drop functionality
- The ability to create and delete boards
- User Management
